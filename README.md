Technical patterns for integrating organisations using x-road

This is a collection of graphics and XeLaTeX that results in a document describing ways organisations can talk to each other using x-road or other secure communications channel. 

For most users, one should get a PDF version from the release and report any issues or shortcomings as issues.

For the ones desiring to compile the PDF themselves, it is recommended to get a TeXLive installation from https://www.tug.org/texlive/. The document should fully complile using the standard installation with the following workflow:
* XeLaTeX
* BibTex
* MakeIndex
* XeLaTeX
* XeLaTeX
