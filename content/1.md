title: Straight up x-road
permalink: /1/

## Overview
This pattern encompasses the simplest possible way x-road can be used. On the consumer side, a new request towards x-road is sent via a new socket for every service request and the thread blocks until a response is received. On the service provider side, all incoming requests from the security server are immediately dispatched to the information system to be serviced. The setup is illustrated by  [figure](#figure1).

While not ideal, the pattern is the simplest possible to implement and is thus widely spread. In a way, the rest of the patterns supplement this one by eliminating one ore more of its weaknesses in some way.

## Summary
 * **Paradigm orientation** The pattern is mainly suitable for data-oriented applications, service and document are not recommended
 * **Volume preference** The pattern is only usable for small or very small volumes
 * **Direction** The pattern can be used on both sides of the service
 * **Availability** The pattern is suitable only when the other side has significantly higher availability requirements than the side where the pattern is applied

## SWOT

### Strengths
The key strength of the pattern is that it simple to implement requiring minimal architectural consideration and adding minimal complexity to the code. Also, because of lack of moving parts, it is simple to configure and deploy. This claims back some of the otherwise considerable operational difficulty it brings.

### Weaknesses
 * The pattern is difficult to troubleshoot. Usually live applications are not equipped with sufficient telemetry to detect the reasons the system is running out of a resource (especially if it is something that is limited by the operating system like threads). Thus, an x-road call from the request processing thread can remain hanging without a good way of detecting or remedying the situation.
 * The pattern does not recover well from incoming request spikes. The response time of Bob depends on the number of parallel requests at Alice. Therefore, should the number of incoming requests grow rapidly, Bob's response time will not improve unless the incoming request rate drops below the rate at which Bob is able to service requests during the spike. This can be a much lower number than under normal conditions. Since load spikes can be hard to observer directly, the system can suffer low performance for no apparent reason: the load is average but response times are much higher. 
 * The security server in itself does not provide load balancing requiring an external mechanism for handling large volumes of either incoming or outgoing requests

### Opportunities
Using a simple x-road integration allows one to get up and running quickly and efficiently

### Threats
 * Seen by Alice, the pattern is susceptible to positive feedback should the performance of Bob deteriorate. Typically system response times are a function of the number of parallel requests being processed: the more parallel requests, the higher the probability of them waiting for some shared resource. When this pattern is utilised on the consumer side, increasing response times from Bob mean more parallel requests (given constant incoming request flow) which in turn means lower performance on the server side which leads to even more parallel requests attempting to access Bob. The system will not recover from such a situation unless incoming request flow drops below Bob's response rate. This is usually known as dynamic complexity leakage.
 * The pattern tends to exhaust resources. Because of the feedback loop described previously, the number of parallel requests waiting for Bob will grow until the number of threads (or another limiting resource) is exhausted. This means that even if minority of users of Alice require a badly performing service from Bob, eventually all users will suffer as Alice runs out of resources. 
 * Since the security server assumes safe network context, a breach of network perimeter can lead the attacker to access all X-Road services on behalf of the organisation unless additional access control measures (like the gateway pattern described in section \ref{sec:p:8}) are implemented.
