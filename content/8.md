# Gateway to x-road
## Overview
Sometimes it is desirable to interact with x-road from a secondary context that might use different protocols or security models. For example, a Javascript based user interface deployed in the browser might need to execute x-road queries. One might also envision a collection of CORBA-based legacy systems. A gateway can also translate between interaction paradigms providing synchronous clients access to asynchronous services and vice versa.

In such a case, a gateway needs to be implemented that performs the security context switch as well as translating protocols. The setup is illustrated by [figure](figure8).

## Summary
 * **Paradigm orientation** The gateway pattern is less suitable for document-based interaction than it is for data and services
 * **Volume preference** Because of added complexity of protocol and security context translation, the pattern is best for medium to large volumes
 * **Direction** The gateway pattern is direction-agnostic 
 * **Availability** As the gateway provides an additional failure handling facility, it is suitable for situations with Alice having higher availability requirements than Bob

## Details
For protocol translation, the gateway must, in most cases, necessarily implement something listening to a socket on one side and something writing to a socket connection on the other. Such a situation of having to implement relatively fast-running logic between two relatively high-latency connections can easily lead to inefficiencies in resource use. For example, incoming sockets and threads could end up waiting for the service behind the security server to respond. Therefore, an asynchronous mechanism separating the concerns of listening to requests, translating them and passing them on to the security server is usually desirable.

In addition to protocol translation, the gateway must have knowledge of message routing. In the simplest case, this is simply comprised of the security server location and the service details to be called. In more complex situations, however, the gateway might need to decide upon the service and security server details based on the incoming request. This usually necessitates a dynamic mapping algorithm or a separate configuration that needs to be kept updated as the target service information changes  and new services are added (see [section](section8ops)). 

To successfully translate between different security domains, the gateway myst be able to translate both credentials and access rules. As opposed to relatively static routing information, information on security credentials and access control is highly dynamic. Therefore, it would be desirable to have an external identity provider residing in the security domain of the accessing system. The gateway, acting as a Service Provider, could utilise a SAML-like protocol to obtain an identity assertion from the identity provider. Based on this, access to services brokered by the security server could be granted. This implies that the need to be aware of routing changes is there for the identity provider as well: it is not possible to grant access to a service one is not aware of. 

## SWOT
### Strengths
 * Clean separation of concerns. The gateway pattern cleanly separates between three different concerns: accessing services, providing identity and providing services. This allows the security server not to care about external identity providers or protocol implementations while the accessing system does not need to know about security server implementation details
 * Explicit security boundary. By design, the security server assumes the incoming service requests to be legitimate. The gateway pattern implements an explicit access control boundary to X-Road allowing for arbitrarily fine-grained security configuration 
 * The gateway is easy to scale. As there is no inherent reason for the gateway to have persistent state, it is easy to scale horizontally

### Weaknesses
 * More moving parts. Another moving element in the signal chain increases system complexity makes monitoring, reliability, message routing etc. more difficult. Because of the exponential nature of complexity, one additional element could push the system complexity beyond the capabilities of the organisation.
 * Breaks end-to-end encryption. Since the gateway usually executes protocol translation, it breaks end-to-end encryption. This makes the gateway a sensitive spot in terms of logging and application integrity. 

### Opportunities
 * Logging/SLA monitoring. As the gateway sees all requests passing to and from the security server, it can implement flow-dependent services like SLA monitoring or audit logging
 * Failover and load balancing. Because the gateway controls the routing mechanism and does protocol translation, it can provide transparent failure handling and failover in case either the security server or services behind it are not available. The gateway can also provide load balancing between security server instances
 * Asynchronicity translation. Because the gateway implements protocol translation, it can also implement an abstraction layer hiding either synchronicity or asynchronicity of the services behind the security server. It could implement a synchronous API while actually sending messages to service providers and waiting for response. It could also implement a call-back mechanism for accessing high-latency backend services
 * Graceful downtime. As the gateway, by definition, is the way to access back-end services it provides a convenient way to handle service downtime. Should the security server itself or Bobs service experience planned downtime, the gateway can be used to either re-route the requests or respond with appropriate error messages in a controlled fashion

### Threats
 * The need for an external identity provider. Abstracting access control logic from the gateway to an external identity provider does not make the logic simpler or easier to defend. As the identity provider controls all access to the security server, it should be treated as a sensitive piece of software it is. Also, the gateway must implement measures of validating the identity of the identity provider and secure communications with it
 * Weak point in security. As the gateway fundamentally is located on the system boundary and, commonly, breaks encryption, it is an obvious attack for a target. Therefore, its interfaces, protocol implementations and operational parameters must be treated accordingly

## Operational considerations
<a name="section8ops"></a>
Firstly, the gateway relies heavily on the identity provider for request processing. Therefore, while the gateway might be easy to scale, it still depends on performance and availability of the identity provider making the latter the choke point of the system. 

Secondly, the gateway needs to be monitored for security server performance. While issues with the service being called should not have an impact on the security server performance, they should still be monitored for. Certain service calls taking abnormally long time, internal queues filling up, etc. should be kept an eye on. It is also a good idea to implement the gateway in a manner that allows for graceful degradation of service returning meaningful error messages rather than having the client time out.

Finally, the gateway should be closely monitored for routing issues. Any mapping between address spaces assumes certain stability on both sides. Thus, changes in either can lead to issues only detectable at the gateway. For example, a new user interface might make use of a new X-Road service that has not been properly configured at the gateway or identity provider.
