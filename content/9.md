## Overview
In case of high-volume or high-importance interaction, it is often important to make sure both sides have the same understanding of what has happened and detect errors. The errors might be caused by technical issues in the communication stack, by failures of either party or because of logical discrepancies stemming, for example, from different interpretations of the response codes. Detection and automated recovery of such errors is especially important in financial settings where, for example, books might be closed daily. For this purpose, a detailed log of all interactions is kept and a special subsystem frequently attempts to reconcile that log with Bob. For simple cases, both Alice and Bob might expose an interface for just comparing the sum of all transactions processed but in more complex settings detailed information like a list of all package IDs might be exchanged. The pattern is depicted on [figure](#figure9).

## Summary
 * **Paradigm orientation** The pattern is suitable for documents, data and service
 * **Volume preference** Unless a very noisy communication channel is used, the pattern only becomes useful under very large request volumes
 * **Direction** The pattern is agnostic towards service direction and could be used by both parties simultaneously
 * **Availability** The pattern is suitable for situations where the availability requirements of the Alice side are higher than on Bob's side

## Details
[Figure](#figure9) contains the component diagram of the reconciliator pattern. The adapter component is responsible for intermediating a service from the security server to the information system. When doing that, it logs the interaction along with its outcome in the communication log. Note, that this creates a problem known as multi-phase commit: we must make sure that the service outcome in the information system and the log are the same. While this is the same fundamental problem the pattern is meant to solve, both parties of the issue are now local and one of them, the communication log, can be very simple. Having reduced the problem to a well-known one, we leave the detailed solution to the reader as an exercise. The communication log exposes an additional interface to the security server allowing for access to the stored log events. These can be accessed then by the information system on Bob's side so system states can be compared. The event log might be detailed listing all logs with outcomes, might just contain failed interactions or just consist of aggregate results like sums. To limit the potential size and complexity of the reports, it is recommended that a maximum reconciliation horizon is agreed upon between parties.

The pattern can be implemented as two mirrored instances allowing for both parties to request for the state of the other. Although it is preferable the reconciliation to be automated, the pattern does not enforce it and the discrepancies found might be routed to a human agent for resolution.

## SWOT

### Strengths
 * Transactional integrity. The reconciliator pattern allows for both parties to ensure the information systems of all parties correctly reflect their logical business relationship  
 * Operational flexibility. If a reconciliator is in place, the operational requirements between the parties drop significantly. Instead of having to implement correct recovery procedures for each error condition individually, it can now be assumed the reconciliator will transfer any messages dropped, for example, because of server restarts. Also, recovery from a data loss becomes a matter of generating a suitable report at the end of the reconciliation period
 * Easy recovery from information system errors. In addition to interface errors, the pattern allows to recover from both technical and logical failures of the information system
 * Robust business processes. Implementation of the reconciliator explicitly surfaces business process decisions around failure recovery. A more robust business process results. 

### Weaknesses
 * Higher complexity. In addition to the interfaces providing direct business value, the organisation must provide another interface along with everything that goes with it (documentation, operations, maintenance, testing etc.). Also, the solution to the local multi-phase commit is not necessarily trivial
 * Restrictions to the information system. In case a discrepancy is discovered between the states of the systems, the information system must allow for these to be rectified. For example, in case of financial systems, the reconciliation must take place before the common change-of-day procedures or both systems must allow for changes in already closed books. 
 * Relationships with the business process. The business process, in order to account for reconciliation, must take into account system failure making it more robust but at the same time requiring it to cross the usual competence boundaries between different responsibility areas

### Opportunities
 * Business meaning. Although the reconciliator is meant as a technical tool for (semi) automatic system reconciliation, it can be used to convey business meaning. For example, in addition to technical information, useful statistics, SLA. An agreement between two parties about the exact levels of services provided reports. 

### Threats
 * Large volumes of data. In case large amounts of messages are exchanged, a naive reconciliation implementation can be resource-consuming for example, if a list of all messages exchanged is attempted to be transmitted. In order to prevent this, the semantics and structure of the report must be designed to work for all scenario (complete data loss on one side, for example) and message volumes

## Operational considerations
Form the operational perspective, the pattern offers few specific challenges. Although it is designed for easy recovery from system failures, excessive reliance on its abilities can cause of domino effect where a voluminous reconciliation report causes one of the systems to under-perform leading to more failed messages and more need for reconciliation. Also, the message log and information system must operationally be thought of as a logical entity, i.e. they should be backed up and recovered in a way that does not compromise their synchronicity.
